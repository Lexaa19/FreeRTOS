# FreeRTOS-Arduino
This repository contains the source code from the course "Arduino RTOS Course Online" offered by Mind Luster. <br>
<h4><b>In the first file, called "sketch_jun24a" I have accomplished the following:</h4></b>
1. Printing to the serial monitor "Task 1" and "Task 2" <br>
2. Using a button with Arduino Uno to show the power of FreeRTOS.<br> 
   By pressing the button, the serial monitor, was still printing "Task print", so the output was not interrupted.<br>

   If RTOS hadn't been used, the code would have frozen until the button was released.<br>
